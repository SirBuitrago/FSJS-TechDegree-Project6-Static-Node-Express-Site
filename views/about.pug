            | I am currently an intern at Adnama Group working on the front-end and back-end development of client websites.
            | I've always tinkered with computer hardware and electronics. Programming or coding seemed an organic next step in my interests and sparked a new career choice in my life. 
            | I hope to build an extensive list of both, personal and work related projects to really solidify my knowledge as a full stack developer. 
            | I've learned invaluable skills in all the jobs I've held throughtout my work life. Such as Communication, Time-Management, Accountability and Complex problem solving.
            | Experience instrumenting applications with real user metrics to reflect the customer experience.
